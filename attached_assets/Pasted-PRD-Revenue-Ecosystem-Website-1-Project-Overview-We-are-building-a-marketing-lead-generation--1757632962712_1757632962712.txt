PRD — Revenue Ecosystem Website

1. Project Overview

We are building a marketing + lead generation site to align our revenue ecosystem message and drive inbound strategy calls.

Goals:
	•	Communicate the problem: revenue team misalignment.
	•	Position our solution: tech + strategy + analytics.
	•	Build trust with social proof (case studies).
	•	Drive conversion with Calendly bookings.
	•	Keep the site fast, modern, and low-cost by using a static-first approach.
